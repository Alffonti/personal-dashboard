The project features a personal dashboard with different widget: cryptocurrency data,  to  lighten or darken a color based on the user's selection. The Hex code is converted into the RGB system in order to alter the color. The design is similar to [Momentum](https://momentumdash.com/) dashborad chrome extension.
